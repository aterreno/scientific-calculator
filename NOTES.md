- Claude gave up quickly on C++ and Erlang rewriting the services in Python, it also started with nim for one of the services, then gave up quickly and went to Python
- Some languages are 'more supported than others', meaning the example of the code that claude is picking up are more recent, I gave up trying to fix Scala as it was running on JDK17 for example 
- Sadly Claude doesn't add tests or local running instructions by default
- Nobody asked Claude for a test coverage for Kotlin but it did it anyway 
- Absolutely insane power in automating writing unit tests, amazing
- Absolutely insane for automating documentation 
- Limits on picking up latest versions, but could be fixed perhaps with better prompting
- Spotted a problem with elixir code base; validation on incoming json, if it's a string
